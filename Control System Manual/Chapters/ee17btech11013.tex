   A lead Compensator network includes a parallel combination of R and C in feed-forward path. If the transfer function of compensator  is $$G_c(s) = \frac{s+2}{s+4}$$, the value of RC is ?\\
   And also find the value of RC for a lead compensator used in previuos example. $$G_c(s) = \frac{3(s+\frac{1}{3})}{s+1}$$

Solution:\\
The transfer function for the following circuit is
    $$
    T(s) = \frac{V_o}{V_i}
    $$
    Let
    $$
    \alpha = \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}
    $$
    and 
    $$
    \tau = R_1C
    $$

Now our T(s) is 
    $$
    T(s) = \frac{R_2}{\frac{\frac{1}{sC}R1}{\frac{1}{sC}+R1} + R2}
    $$
    Simplifying T(s)
    $$
    T(s) = \frac{s+\frac{1}{\tau}}{s+\frac{1}{\tau\alpha}}
    $$
    Comparing with the given $$G_c(s) = \frac{s+2}{s+4}$$
    $$
    \tau = R_1C = 0.5
    $$
    for
    $$
    T(s) = \frac{3(s+\frac{1}{3})}{s+1}
    $$
    here this is a lead compensator with a gain of 3.
    so we can simply write passive circuit part as.
     $$
    T(s) = \frac{(s+\frac{1}{3})}{s+1}
    $$
    again by comparing with 
    $$
    T(s) = \frac{s+\frac{1}{\tau}}{s+\frac{1}{\tau\alpha}}
    $$
    
    $$\tau = 3$$
    $$RC = 3$$
